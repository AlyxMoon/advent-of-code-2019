# Advent of Code 2019

This repo contains the code I've made and used to find solution to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) challenges.

Initially I had a standalone script for each day/part. However after repeated instances of using the 'intcode computer' I figured it was best to make some parts more generic. And then I got carried away making an interactive console.

#### How do I use this?
1) Run `yarn` to install necessary packages
2) Run `yarn start` to begin the program
3) Here you will be presented a menu through the console to select the solution for a given day/part.
